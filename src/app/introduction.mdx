# Welcome!

This is a sample [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to test its integrations with [Figma](https://figma.com/) and feasibility as a tool to build our design system on. The project is available in GitHub under [eduard-io/taskbox](https://github.com/eduard-io/taskbox).

## Process

At a very-high level the process to test/build this project has been:

1. Follow the [Storybook for Angular tutorial](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/angular/en/get-started/) tutorial
2. Replicate some of the components of the tutorial in Figma
3. Publish project to GitHub
4. Sign-up and configure [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) integration 
5. Install and configure [@storybook/addon-designs](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-designs), to display Figma in Storybook stories
6. Install and configure the [Storybook Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect) Figma plugin to visualize Storybook stories in Figma
7. Add extra documentation

## Structure

The structure of this project is as follows:
- *Welcome*: this documentation page
- *Foundations*: a sample page where foundations could be added
- *Example*: folder with 3 example components auto-generated by Storybook. Interesting to see the `Controls`features
- *App*: added during the tutoral, contains a sample `Page` with two status. In real life there would be a specific section for each app containing the specific pages and non-shared components.
- *Design System*: added during the tutorial, this folder would contains the shared design system components. In this case it's organized following [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) approach, even though no atom has been yet created.
